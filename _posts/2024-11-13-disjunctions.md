<div class="post-background">
    <p>Many coastal marine species have discontinuous distributions or genetic breakpoints throughout their geographical ranges. These spatial and genetic disjunctions occur in species that span limited to broad dispersal potential. We reviewed the mechanisms that are proposed to underlie these disjunctions and visualized these results.
