    <p>Many benthic marine species have broadly dispersed planktonic larvae. Since long larval periods in benthic species can be associated with high dispersal potential and gene flow, it has sometimes historically been assumed that these organisms are also well-mixed genetically. However, over the past decades, many studies have found surprising genetic and spatial patchiness among broadly dispersing benthic marine invertebrates. However, most studies investigating the population genetics of benthic marine species have utilized targeted small-scale sequencing approaches, which sometimes offer an incomplete view of population structure and gene flow. In this project, we used low-coverage whole-genome sequencing to investigate the population genetic structure of one such species with a long-lived planktonic larva, the bat star <em>Patiria miniata</em>. This project is in progress - but feel free to contact me for more information!</p>
