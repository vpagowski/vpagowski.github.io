description: "I am a PhD candidate at Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University, specializing in marine population genomics with a focus on California’s benthic invertebrate species. My research combines molecular techniques and computational approaches to deepen our understanding of marine biodiversity and to inform conservation strategies. Throughout my doctoral work, I have explored a diverse array of methodologies—including advanced molecular techniques, microscopy, and comprehensive literature analyses. You can find more detailed information on specific projects below.

Beyond my core research, I am passionate about the intersections of science with policy, art, and education. I enjoy combining creative and analytical skillsets and visualizing complex scientific concepts by making nuance beautiful and accessible through creative communication."
