My research combines molecular techniques and computational approaches to deepen our understanding of marine biodiversity and to inform conservation strategies. Throughout my doctoral work, I have explored a diverse array of methodologies—including advanced molecular techniques, microscopy, and comprehensive literature analyses. You can find more detailed information on specific projects below.
Beyond my core research, I am passionate about the intersections of science with policy, art, and education. I enjoy combining creative and analytical skillsets and visualizing complex scientific concepts by making nuance beautiful and accessible through creative communication.</subtitle><author><name>Veronica Pagowski</name></author><entry><title type="html">Imaging And Identification Of Larval Neurons</title><link href="https://vpagowski.github.io/imaging-and-identification-of-larval-neurons" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Imaging And Identification Of Larval Neurons" /><published>2024-11-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-11-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://vpagowski.github.io/Imaging-and-Identification-of-Larval-Neurons</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://vpagowski.github.io/imaging-and-identification-of-larval-neurons">&lt;div class=&quot;post-background&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Many benthic marine species have broadly dispersed planktonic larvae. Since long larval periods in benthic species can be associated with high dispersal potential and gene flow, it has sometimes historically been assumed that these organisms are also well-mixed genetically. However, over the past decades, many studies have found surprising genetic and spatial patchiness among broadly dispersing benthic marine invertebrates. However, most studies investigating the population genetics of benthic marine species have utilized targeted small-scale sequencing approaches, which sometimes offer an incomplete view of population structure and gene flow. In this project, we used low-coverage whole-genome sequencing to investigate the population genetic structure of one such species with a long-lived planktonic larva, the bat star &lt;em&gt;Patiria miniata&lt;/em&gt;. This project is in progress - but feel free to contact me for more information!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;white-text&quot;&gt;Many coastal marine species have discontinuous distributions or genetic breakpoints throughout their geographical ranges. These spatial and genetic disjunctions occur in species that span limited to broad dispersal potential. We reviewed the mechanisms that are proposed to underlie these disjunctions and visualized these results.
